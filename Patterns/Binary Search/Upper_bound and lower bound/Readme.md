This is another pattern for binary search in which after observing the question you  
will get to a conclusion to find element which is >= / > the current element from   
given vector or map or set for which we can directly use binary search but here    
using STL lower_bound and upper_bound will make it easy   
lower_bound-->   ">="
upper bound-->   ">"
