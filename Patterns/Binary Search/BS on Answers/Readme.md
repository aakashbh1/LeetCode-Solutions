In this patter we are needed to find maximum or minimum but binary search is not clearly visible at first glanse
But in this type of pattern there is range which is fixed for answers so it is also known as binary search on answer 
We have a low and high of answer in which it will lie. 
Then we have a check function which check if current answer is possible or not and on that basis aur low and high moves.
